# Dart Reduce Function and Empty Lists
This example demonstrates a common error when using the `reduce` function in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce` function requires at least one element in the list to operate correctly. Attempting to use it on an empty list results in an error.

The solution provided adds a check for an empty list before calling `reduce`, preventing the error and providing a more robust solution.
